# So...

Anyone who has worked with me knows that though I can do frontend work and know a lot of the nuances when it comes to loading resources important to styling a page... They all know how much I loathe it and would much rather work on profiling apps and making things faster, or doing some database maintenance/setting up some cronjobs.

I do believe others are better suited than I am to make a beautiful design, and a lot more naturually/easily. I often give the example working as a chef during college. I'm OK being super busy cooking multiple meals simultaneously, but once you have me breading shrimp it just feels so tedious and unproductive. I feel like me working on design brings me back to those days, and I would almost always rather be doing something else backend-y (uhhh if you're hiring and reading here and needed some front-end work JK! Let's work together :D). Just don't make me do it all the time is all I ask.

## For the confession

TBH most of the design on this site is from some AI and me telling it to make it better. Obviously it does a bad job sometimes so I will just tweak it here and there to fix the various issues, but it's a nice starting point. I don't recommend it in a commercial setting but you'll have to deal with it here on my site. Sorry not sorry.

I admit I am not as bullish on AI as a lot of folks are, but it is useful for annoying tedious tasks I don't want to do in non-critical situations. It can also be very dumb.
